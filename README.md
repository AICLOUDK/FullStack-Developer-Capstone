Server and Network
Server: A powerful computer that stores data, runs applications, and responds to requests from other computers (clients). Think of it as a central hub that provides resources or services over the internet or an intranet. For example, when you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the web server, which responds by sending the website data.

Network: A collection of connected computers and devices that communicate with each other. It enables data transfer between clients (like your laptop or phone) and servers. The internet is the largest network, connecting millions of devices worldwide.

Full Stack Development
Full Stack Developer: A programmer skilled in both frontend (what users see) and backend (server-side logic and databases) development. They handle everything from designing user interfaces to managing data storage and server logic.
The Relationship
Server & Network in Full Stack Development:  

Full stack developers often work with servers to deploy web applications. They write backend code that runs on servers, which respond to user requests over the network.
The network enables communication between the user's device (client) and the server hosting the application.
For example, when a user submits a form on a website, the request travels over the network to the server, which processes it and sends back a response.
In summary:  

The server hosts the application and data.
The network allows devices (clients) to connect and communicate with the server.
Full stack developers build the entire system â€” creating the frontend interface, writing backend logic that runs on servers, and managing how data moves across the network.
